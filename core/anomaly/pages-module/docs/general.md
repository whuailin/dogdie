### Page Types

Every page on a website has some sort of specific purpose. For example, a page's purpose could be to display a member of a company's staff, display a product, or display contact information for a company's branch.

The Pages module makes it easy to manage each of these `Page Types`. Each page has common fields (like metadata, title, etc), but can also use custom fields assigned to it's Page Type. For example, for your staff member page you can create a Staff Member page type and add a Bio and Headshot image field. You could create a Product page type too, with all sorts of fields like product description, price, etc. Using Page Types you can easily create rich pages for the various types of pages you need to display.
